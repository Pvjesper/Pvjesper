## ⚡⚡ Hi ⚡⚡
I research sound field estimation and sound field control, with a particular interest in kernel methods. Below are Python packages containing a variety of signal processing code, implemented in numpy/scipy and JAX. 

## Code
### Audio Signal Processing Collection (ASPCOL)
**Sound field estimation and sound field control**  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/aspcol  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/aspcol  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/aspcol/

### Audio Signal Processing Simulator (ASPSIM)
**Sound simulation software built on the image-source method of pyroomacoustics**  
Built on top of pyroomacoustics to easily simulate adaptive sound reproduction.  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/aspsim  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/aspsim  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/aspsim/

### Audio Signal Processing Core (ASPCORE) 
**Classic signal processing**  
Features include time-varying MIMO filters for streaming signals, discrete Fourier transforms, adaptive filters, functions for handling block matrices, covariance estimation, and more.  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/aspcore  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/aspcore  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/aspcore  

### Riemannian Covariance Estimation (RIECOVEST)
**Estimation of covariance matrices from noisy signal and noise-only data, built on pyManopt and JAX**  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/riecovest  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/riecovest  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/riecovest  

## Datasets
### Rotating Moving Microphone Sound field (RoMMS) dataset
**Dataset for sound field estimation using a moving microphone**  
Code : https://github.com/Pvjesper/romms  
Data : https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15124905
