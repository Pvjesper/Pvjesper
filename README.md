## ⚡⚡ Hi ⚡⚡
I'm a PhD student at STADIUS, KU Leuven, researching sound field estimation and sound field control as part of the SOUNDS ETN. Below are four Python packages developed during the project, each of which can be installed and used directly using pip install PKGNAME. 

### Audio Signal Processing Collection (ASPCOL)
**Sound field estimation and sound field control**  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/aspcol  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/aspcol  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/aspcol/

### Audio Signal Processing Simulator (ASPSIM)
**Sound simulation software built on the image-source method of pyroomacoustics**  
Features include moving sources and microphones, directional microphones, and adaptive sound reproduction.  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/aspsim  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/aspsim  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/aspsim/

### Audio Signal Processing Core (ASPCORE) 
**Classic signal processing**  
Features include time-varying MIMO filters for streaming signals, discrete Fourier transforms, adaptive filters, functions for handling block matrices, covariance estimation, and more.  
Code : github.com/sounds-research/aspcore  
Docs : sounds-research.github.io/aspcore  
PyPI : pypi.org/project/aspcore  

### Riemannian Covariance Estimation (RIECOVEST)
**Estimation of covariance matrices from noisy signal and noise-only data, built on pyManopt and JAX**  
Code : https://github.com/sounds-research/riecovest  
Docs : https://sounds-research.github.io/riecovest  
PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/riecovest  

### Rotating Moving Microphone Sound field (RoMMS) dataset
**Dataset for sound field estimation using a moving microphone**
Code : github.com/Pvjesper/romms
Data : doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15124905
